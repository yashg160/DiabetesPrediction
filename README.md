# Diabetes Prediction

In this mini-project, I trained a logistic regression model to correctly predict a diabetes diagnosis in patients.

The file **prediction.py** is the main file where the model was trained, and then saved. The file **check.py** is the file where I use some validation data and a sample to check for the probability of the prediction and check if the model iis working correctly.
